/**
 * Parses a word using a context free grammar by simulating a nondeterministic stack machine that produces the given
 * word.
 * 
 * A depth-first-search is used to traverse the decision tree, which is faster than a breadth-first but imposes certain
 * restrictions on the grammar. Specifically, the first element in any replacement rule may not be equal to the
 * NonTerminal being replaced, and may not be (indirectly) be replaced by the NonTerminal. In other words, a recursion
 * may not be directly or indirectly be initiated by the first symbol in a rule.
 * 
 * For example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * <Sequence> ::= <Statement> | <Statement> \";\" <Sequence>
 * <Statement> ::= <SetZero> | <Assign> | <Increment> | <While>
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * is ok, but
 * 
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * <Statement> ::= <SetZero> | <Assign> | <Increment> | <While> | <Statement> \";\" <Statement>
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * is not (will lead to an infinite recursion/memory overflow).
 * 
 * The decision tree is not explicitly modeled, since only the current path (from root decision to the current decision)
 * is of interest, and all old paths and nodes correspond to invalid productions. Since decisions only occur on
 * NonTerminal instances, where rules are selected, the current path on the decision tree is comprised of a linked list
 * of NTermInst instances. Specifically, the {@link Parser#lastDecision} variable refers to the NonTerminal instance
 * where the last decision was made. Since each NonTerminal instance contains a reference
 * ({@link SymbolInst#parentDecision}) to the previous decision, the reverse path to the first decision can be obtained.
 * 
 * The syntax tree, however, is modeled explicitly. The {@link Parser#root} variable contains the root NonTerminal
 * instance of the syntax tree. The {@link Parser#current} variable contains a reference to the node currently being
 * investigated (same as {@link Parser#root} in the beginning). In each parser step, for NonTerminal instances, a new
 * child for the current node is created and set as the current one. For Terminal instances, their text is checked for
 * equality with the parsed word. After processing of a Terminal instance, and when all children of a NonTerminal
 * instance have been parsed, a recursion return is performed, i.e. the parent of the current node is set as the current
 * node. When the root node is reached again, the word is accepted if no more characters remain to be parsed, and
 * rejected if there are superfluous characters.
 * 
 * If a decision turns out to be wrong - i.e. a Terminal symbol does not match the parsed word - a backtrack step is
 * performed, i.e. the last decision is revised, and the next replacement rule for that NTermInst is checked. If all
 * rules have been tried, another backtrack step is performed. If during backtracking a NTermInst with
 * {@link SymbolInst#parentDecision} = null is found, i.e. there are no more decisions to revise, a syntax error in the
 * word is assumed, i.e. the word is not accepted. During backtracking, all syntax tree elements that were generated
 * since the last decision have to be removed ({@link Parser#clearDecisions}), and new ones will be generated according
 * to the new decision.
